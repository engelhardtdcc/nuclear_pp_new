                Another strategy for dealing with energy overproduction involves a set of measures directed
                at increasing energy consumption by creating new electricity-dependent infrastructures.
                Given the absence of growth in energy consumption within the last 12 years, the conclusive
                attempts to change the dire situation a few months before the commissioning of the first
                WWER-1200 at Astravets in 2016 are futile. To go into details, Belarusian authorities
                expected to increase energy consumption by introducing new manufactories and enterprises
                and re-equipping and transferring the existing ones to electricity. According to the Decree of
                the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus № 169, dated 01.03.2016 and edited in
                2018 entitled “Intersectoral package of measures to increase electricity consumption until
                2026,” the Belarusian government plans to spend 7.7 billion Belarusian rubles on
                infrastructural projects to guarantee additional 1,6 billion kWh consumption per year. The
                biggest enterprises of the Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Transport and Communications,
                Ministry of Architecture and Construction, Ministry of Housing and Communal Services,
                regional executive committees, Minsk city executive committee will be subjected to re-
                equipment.
                <br>
                <br>
                The massive electricity overproduction caused by the Astravyets NPP forces the Belarusian
                government to restructure all the biggest producing enterprises. Thus the enterprises would
                become dependent on Russia as a resource provider and surplus energy consumer. Among the
                enterprises that will transition to electricity are Amkodor, Belgard JSC, Minsk Engine
                Factory, BelAZ, OJSC Byelorussian Steel Works, Minsk Tractor Works, Atlant Appliance
                Company, Belarusian Railways, Belneftekhim, Bellegprom and 39 more. The problem,
                however, is that the energy consumption increase plan requires additional financial
                investments of 7725,6 million Belarusian rubles or more than 3 billion dollars. Despite
                immense financial investments, this set of measures is drastically ineffective and insufficient.
                These measures would allow for covering only 11.4% of the Astravyets produced surplus
                energy by 2026 while the overproduction is happening already in 2021.
                Due to the ineffectiveness of the above mentioned strategy, the government released another
                programme in 2021 entitled “the Programme for the increase in electricity consumption for
                the needs of heating, hot water supply and food preparation.” The aim of the programme is to
                increase the electricity consumption rate in the civil sector. According to the programme, it is
                expected to carry out the reconstruction of energy transmission lines of all classes and types,
                to transit single-family houses and apartment buildings with stove heating and gas supply to
                the use of electrical energy for heating, water supply, and food preparation by the year 2025.
                Moreover, the programme includes the construction of new apartment buildings in residential
                areas and individual areas with private housing. In other words, all the new housing that is
                going to be constructed from 2021 onwards will rely on electricity as a primary and only
                energy supply.
                <br>
                <br>
                The government feverishly fosters the transition of already existing housing from alternative
                resources to electricity. The transition of houses to electricity is expected to increase energy
                consumption rates both during day and night. By 2025, together with all the measures
                undertaken, the expected increase will be 900 million KWh which makes only 6.43% of the
                Astravyets overproduced energy. While being overall inefficient, the strategy also requires
                significant financial investments of 3.6 million Belarusian rubles to create new electricity-
                dependent infrastructures. In turn, the sum of financial investments is higher than the entire
                Belarusian investments in the construction of the NPP itself. And again, the aforementioned
                set of measures is expected to give the results only in 2025 while the overproduction is
                happening now.
                <br>
                <br>
                Such catastrophically large financial investments needed to increase the energy consumption
                rates from cross-sectoral and civil sectors combined by 2.5 billion kWh by the year 2025 are
                critically inadequate. Moreover, the financial investments required for the utilization of
                13.9% of surplus energy are several times as high as the investments in the construction of
                the NPP itself. To foster the electrification process, Lukashenko issued a presidential decree
                №127 on reimbursement of electricity supply costs in 2020. According to the degree, the
                government promises to cover 20% of the houses&#39; electrification costs for existing houses.
                The problem is that the state covers 20% of the cost of electricity meters and electric boilers
                only which is a smaller part of all the expenses needed for electrification. Most of the costs,
                including the installation of batteries and hot water circulation systems, are not even partially
                covered by compensation. Moreover, in order to receive a financial refund, you need to join
                the compensation queue. Allocation to the queue happens only according to the special
                request. Information about the need to queue up for reimbursement of expenses is not
                communicated in the media. This information is also hushed up on the corresponding
                administrative points. Most people either do not know about the possibility of receiving
                financial compensation, or they find out about it after the start of the renovation, when it is no
                longer possible to get on the queue. Together with the presidential decree, the government
                introduced a number of administrative procedures obliging people to pay a total of about 300
                Belarusian rubles for paperwork. These administrative procedures did not exist before the
                decree and were introduced with the aim of levying additional fees from the population. The
                government purposely misleads its population in order to encourage people to electrify their
                homes and use up surplus electricity, as well as to patch the holes in the energy industry
                budget created by the failed nuclear power plant project.
