                Since 2009, Belarusian authorities and Rosatom have been assuring that radioactive waste
                from Astravyets will be sent to Russia for the procession and subsequent storage. The press
                director of Rosatom previously confirmed that the radioactive fuel will not remain in Belarus
                for permanent storage. However, no official agreement of this kind has been signed.
                Nowadays, building on the inability of Belarus to sell surplus energy to other countries, a
                number of EU sanctions, as well as the lack of alternatives for cooperation on waste issues,
                Russia refused to dispose of radioactive waste from the Astravyets nuclear power plant. At
                <br>
                <br> 
                the same time, Russia disposes of radioactive waste from Germany and other European
                countries&#39; nuclear power plants on its territory. In light of the lack of alternatives, the
                irradiated fuel assembly from Astravets NPP will have to be stored in Belarus for a
                substantial time, then sent to Russia for reprocessing with a subsequent return for burial in
                Belarus.
                <br>
                <br> 
                The unpreparedness of Belarus to operate the NPP is felonious. While the plant was
                commissioned in 2020, it is only in August 2021 that Belarusian government is starting to
                think of opening a new department on the basis of Belarusian Ministry of Energy which is
                going to determine the location of the radioactive waste storage and curate it&#39;s forthcoming
                construction. The existing storages in Belarus are worn out and so they are not even
                considered. The most likely location of the radioactive waste storage is going to be in one of
                the NPP neighbouring villages namely: Aveny, Shul&#39;niki, Novodrozhki. The location is
                marked by the presence of seismic activity for which the NPP itself was criticized. The
                renown Gudogai earthquake has happened 30-40 km away from the today’s location of the
                NPP and the future storages.
                <br>
                <br> 
                From the moment of the power start-up, the nuclear power plant began to generate
                radioactive waste. This is an inevitable process — any reactor generates radioactive waste,
                many different types. The information about the types of waste, which should be publicly
                available, is hidden. What is known, however, is that the yet to be built storage would be a
                multipurpose one where the waste from Astravyets and other toxic productions would be
                stored. Clearly, despite the initial promises of permanent disposal in Russia, the radioactive
                waste will be buried in Belarus. For a country that has suffered the most severe damage from
                the Chernobyl NPP catastrophe, hastily creating a radioactive waste burial could also
                potentially lead to an ecological disaster.
                <br>
                <br> 
                The crux of the radioactive waste storage, however, resides not in the waste itself nor its
                potential ecological danger which are real, but in the financial aspect. Officials have publicly
                claimed that the expected price of the storage is 1 billion dollars. In reference to the
                international experience, the announced cost appears to be significantly lowered. The given
                price is realistic for intermediate-level and low-level waste while for the Astravyets, high-
                level waste storage is needed. However, even the very lowest announced price already equals
                the amount invested in the construction of the NPP itself. Unavoidably, the price of the
                project is going to grow which, coupled with the impossibility of selling the overproduced
                energy anywhere except from Russia to which Belarus also has loans to pay, leads to further
                economic dependence.

                All in all, Lukashenko saw the NPP as a guarantor of energy independence from Russia. But
                as a result, a series of miscalculations and negligence in project planning led to the opposite
                results. The desire to save money on the NPP construction by covering only 10% of the of
                nuclear power plant costs and taking loans from Rosatom led to the need for subsequent
                huge financial investments in the conservation of existing GRES’ and CHPs, the construction
                <br>
                <br> 
                of new energy-dependent infrastructures in industry and the civil sector, and the construction
                of nuclear waste burial sites in Belarus. Not to mention the need to sell surplus energy to the
                very same Russia from which Belarus took a loan for the construction of a nuclear power
                plant. The nuclear power plant appeared to become a source of Russian colonial power which
                made it possible to establish control over the Belarusian energy sector and all interconnected
                infrastructures.
                <br>
                <br> 
                The incompetence and shortsightedness of the NPP project managers turned Belarus into a
                space outside the Russian territory which is infrastructurally integrated into it. Lukashenko’s
                NPP poses a direct threat to the sovereignty of Belarus which is no longer supported by
                borders but is being dismantled from within. The Astravyets NPP entails such consequences
                as the separation of the Belarusian state from its own infrastructure, violation of territorial
                integrity, and the creation of toxic zones. The active investments in the realization of the
                Belarusian nuclear power plant dream make resistance to the colonial occupation increasingly
                difficult while simultaneously making integration with Russia more likely. With each passing
                day, the resistance to integration with Russia is becoming more difficult because a simple
                Astravyets NPP shutdown would paralyze the entire Belarusian energy infrastructure, its
                largest manufacturing enterprises, and cities. With the launch of the Astravyets NPP, the
                point of no return has been reached.
