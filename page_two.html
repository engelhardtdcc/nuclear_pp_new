                The Astravyets NPP commissioning in 2020 adds about 18 billion kilowatt-hours (KWh) per
                year to the 36-38 billion KWh that Belarus produces and consumes annually. The gigantic
                addition of 18 billion KWh makes up 40-50% of the entire country’s consumption. It results
                in massive energy overproduction that can not be accommodated by the existing domestic
                infrastructure. Such colossal miscalculation and overproduction were far from being
                unpredictable. It was already in 2008 when numerous researchers that there is no neccessity
                to construct the NPP. However, Lukashenko insisted on implementing the project hoping for
                the growth of energy consumption rates, hypothetical energy independence from Russian gas,
                energy resources diversification, and the possibility of selling the Astravyets energy to the
                neighbouring EU countries. However, the economic stagnation, financial crisis, political
                crisis, and social unrest negatively impacted the energy sector dynamic. As a result, over the
                last 12 years there was no growth of energy consumption which has led to subsequent
                overproduction.
                <br>
                <br>
                The government faced the problem of monstrous energy overproduction and had to come up
                with plans of managing it on the go. At this point, it is crucial to understand the impossibility
                of lowering the operational productivity of NPP. NPPs, by their construction, can only
                function at 100% output mode. Therefore, other ways of managing the overproduced energy
                had to be invented. In 2018, two years after the initial date of the planned NPP
                commissioning and two years before its actual start, the government released a strategy of
                managing the surplus energy. The strategy prioritized Astravyets NPP and revolved around
                creating favourable conditions for its functioning. Therefore, the government decided to
                reduce energy output rates by conserving and reducing the productivity of already existing
                combined heat and power plants (CHP) and natural gas-fired thermal power stations (GRES).
                Decreasing overall energy production on the cost of existing infrastructural enterprises leads
                to the destruction of already existing Belarusian infrastructures while prioritizing Russia-
                sponsored NPP. As a part of the programme entitled “Set of measures to integrate the
                Belarusian NPP into the unified energy system of Belarus” two largest Belarusian energy-
                producing stations were to undergo the installation of peak-reserve capacities: Lukoml GRES
                and Berezov GRES. The peak-reserve capacities are also to be installed at the CHP Minsk - 5
                and Novopolotsk CHP.
                <br>
                <br>

                According to the plan, the installation of peak-reserve capacities is expected to decrease the
                overall energy output while at the same time ensuring the possibility of a quick start and
                uninterrupted electricity supply in case of emergency NPP shutdown. Combined, Lukoml
                and Berezov GRES’ have 4144 MW installed capacity which is technically more than the
                Astravets NPP. However, their output capacity is lower due to the lower power generation
                efficiency of natural gas, which is 42,5 % compared to 90,3 % for uranium. After the
                installation of peak-reserve capacities will be complete, the overall output of the Berezov
                GRES will amount to 250 MW and 150 MW at Lukoml GRES respectively. Additionally, the
                Novopolotsk CHP’s current 270 MW will be reduced to 100 MW of reserve capacities and
                Minsk-5 CHP’s current 719,6 MW to 300 MW.
                <br>
                <br>
                The installation of the peak-reserve capacities and the decrease in energy output means job
                losses in the energy sector and requires additional financial investments. In this way, because
                of the appearance of the Astravyets NPP, Belarusian government started to finance the
                conservation of its own infrastructure. The Lukoml GRES and Berezov GRES are their
                town’s core enterprises. The 1625 employees of the Lukoml GRES make up 12% of the
                entire Novalukoml town population as of 2020. 802 employees of the Berezov GRES in
                Byelaazyorsk make up 7.22% of the town population. Working personnel cuts will cause
                towns to decay and their people to migrate to bigger cities. Creating favourable conditions for
                the functioning of the overproducing NPP means simultaneous conservation of small-town
                core enterprise which goes contrary to Lukashenko’s claims about the equal and balanced
                development of small towns. What happens in reality is that even the existing and still
                operating cities as well as their enterprises are getting destroyed. The personnel cuts are also
                planned for the Minsk-5 CHP and Novopolotsk CHP. In this way, the commissioning of the
                Russia-sponsored Astravyets NPP is happening at the cost of destroying small Belarusian
                cities and existing enterprises.

                The dismantlement of the infrastructure is happening not only inside Belarus but also across
                the Belarusian border. Nowadays, the electricity grid of Lithuania and Latvia operates in
                synchronous mode with the Russian and Belarusian systems known as the “BRELL ring.”
                However, on the 15th of June 2017, The Seimas of the Republic of Lithuania promulgated
                law No XIII-451. Article 1 recognized the nuclear power plant under construction in the
                Astravets District in the Republic of Belarus as unsafe and posing a threat to the national
                security of the Republic of Lithuania, its environment and public health. Signed by president
                Dalia Grybauskaitė, this law instantly blocked any potential energy cooperation between
                Belarus and Lithuania. In solidarity with Lithuania, other EU member countries, including
                Poland and Latvia, rejected Astravets energy. Lithuania aims at preventing any electricity
                flow from the newly constructed Belarus NPP to the European Union, which is impossible as
                long as BRELL exists. Belarus could just send energy to Russia and then sell it to the EU
                while leaving no trace of it being produced by Astravyets. Lithuania initiated the dismantling
                of the BRELL ring to prevent this scenario. The Baltic Synchronisation project involves the
                dismantling of the Belarus - Lithuania transmission lines by 2025.
                The Astravyets overproduced energy can’t be sold to Ukraine either. The annexation of
                Crimea by Russia and the subsequent withdrawal of Ukraine from the Commonwealth of
                Independent States has become a cornerstone for energy cooperation. The Ukrainian prime
                minister Oleksiy Honcharuk confirmed that the country is going to join the European
                ENTSO-E electricity market. After that, Ukraine refused to purchase electricity from the
                Belarusian NPP.

                The conservation and subsequent reduction of the output capacities of the existing
                infrastructure to integrate the overproducing NPP into the Belarusian energy sector has
                critical implications. After the installation of peak-reserves, the enterprises are meant to play
                the role of “supports” for the overproducing NPP. However, Astravyets frequent emergency
                stops make these enterprises provide higher outputs and compensate for the energy shortage
                leading to equipment overloads and accidents. On the 29th of August 2021, the Berezov
                GRES was stopped. The reason for the stoppage turned out to be that the gas consumption
                rate went beyond the planned limit. The limits, of course, were calculated on the conditions
                of normally operating NPP. After the emergency NPP shutdown, the reserve capacities of
                Berezov GRES were turned on to compensate for electricity needs in the region. The
                equipment for the Berezov GRES was not ready to work on the full scale for such a long time
                which has led to an accident. Earlier, on the 23rd of June, there was a transformer explosion
                at the Lukoml GRES due to equipment overload. As a result of this accident, there was a
                power outage in Mogilev and Orsha. The instability of the NPP will continue to cause energy
                shortages and accidents in Belarus because the peak-reserve capacities have already been
                installed. Yet, it is unclear when the NPP would start operating in normal mode. As a result,
                the NPP creates a situation where massive energy overproduction is accompanied by the
                short time outages. While Belarus produces surplus energy that can not be consumed in the
                long run, Belarus faces electricity outages in entire cities.
