              On July 10, 2016, a 334-ton reactor pressure vessel was accidentally dropped from a height
              of 2-4 meters at the Astravyets Nuclear Power Plant construction site. The information about
              the droppage would have remained confidential If not for the noise generated by the object’s
              mass. The geographical closeness of the yet to be finished Nuclear Power Plant to Lithuania
              resulted in registering the light seismic activity of unidentified nature in Vilnius. The intense
              noise generated by the vessel was no louder than the deafening silence of the Belarusian
              officials who tried to conceal the accident. The crane malfunction and the miscalculations in
              the strength of transporting slings resulted in a sag with a subsequent droppage. After the
              Facebook publication of an anti-nuclear activist Nicolai Ylasevich went viral, officials had to
              react (Ylasevich, 2016). What followed was a publication of a statement by Alexander
              Lokshin, the first deputy general director of Rosatom, claiming that the vessel was not
              damaged and no deformations that could result in the change of its properties were detected.
              Noone from the Belarusian State Production Association of Electric Power Industry
              “Belenergo” commented on the situation.

              While the officials in Belarus were trying to nullify public discontent, it was decided that the
              dropped vessel in which “no deformations that could result in the change of its properties
              were detected” would be replaced. However, during transit, the new vessel for the Astravyets
              NPP had hit reinforced concrete support of the contact network of the Belarusian railway
              station “Slavnoe.” In the official statement that followed, it was claimed that the transport
              company representatives, insurers, manufacturers and other organizations examined the shell
              and concluded that it was not damaged. However, the experts of the Belarusian Anti-Nuclear
              Campaign have indicated the inconsistency in the official version. It was claimed that the
              vessel was transported in a protective casing. The released photographs showed that there
              <br>
              <br> 
              was no protective casing on the vessel. Fueled by the overall mistrust towards the
              government, Belarusian activists demanded the re-examination of the vessel. According to
              the international nuclear energy specialists, if the integrity of the vessel is violated, then the
              effective cooling of the core will be disrupted. Such disruptions can lead to overheating and
              potential accidents. Nevertheless, the vessel was delivered and installed. The public re-
              examination of the vessel has never been carried out.

              Russia itself plays a key role in the NPP project. Firstly, Russia provides significant financial
              investments. In 2011, Belarus and Russia signed an intergovernmental agreement about
              allocating funds for Astravyets NPP. According to the agreement, Russia will cover 90% of
              the 10 billion dollars project while Belarus will cover only the remaining 10% of the entire
              costs. Secondly, Russia provides technological investment as the Russian State Atomic
              Energy Corporation Rosatom functions as the general constructor. The main segments of the
              plant, two WWER-1200 (water-water power reactors) with 1200 megawatt (MW) output
              each, were developed and assembled by a Russian state construction office working on the
              design and development of nuclear power plant reactors of the WWER range called
              Hydropress Design Bureau. The reactor vessels were produced and transported to Belarus
              from Atommash, an engineering company located in Volgodonsk, Rostov region, Russia. The
              vessels for Astravyets NPP became the first vessels produced by Atommash after 30 years of
              inactivity. Thirdly, Russia provides the resources for the plant. Belarus does not have natural
              uranium resources, so Russia, with its estimated 500,000 tons of uranium deposits in the
              South Urals, Western Siberia, and Siberia east of Lake Baikal, will be the key importer.
              Before being delivered to Belarus, the uranium for Astravyets NPP will undergo the
              enrichment process at the Novosibirsk Chemical Concentrates Plant, which is also impossible
              without strategic cooperation with Russia.
